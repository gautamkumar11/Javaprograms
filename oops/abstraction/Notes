ABSTRACTION:

- Hiding the implementation details of the class and exposing only the behaviours or services is called as abstraction.


To achieve abstraction we have to follow three steps :

(i) Generalize the methods of implementation class and store them inside the interface.
(ii) Create the object of implementation class and store the address in interface reference variable.
(iii) Use the interface reference variables to access the methods of implementation class.

- Using abstraction we can developed APIs(Application Programming Interface)
- Using abstraction we can achieve Loose Coupling.

To achieve loose coupling we have to create three layers :
(i) Object implementation layer
(ii) Object creation layer
(iii) Object utilization layer
