METHOD OVERLOADING:

- Developing multiple methods with the same name within the same class which differs in
(i) no. of arguments
(ii) data type of arguments
(iii) sequence of arguments
is called as method overloading.

- we can overload both static and non static methods.

Two overloaded method can have different return datatypes.

- with the help of method overloading we can achieve code flexibility.
- Method overloading is the best example for compile time polymorphism
- The binding of method declaration to method definition is done at the compile time and hence it is called as compile time binding or early binding.
- Since the binding is done at the compile time it can not be changed at runtime and hence it is called as static binding.
- It makes easy for the programmer to remember the methods name and increase the readability of program.

Disadvantage of Method Overloading
- The overloaded methods should have required java documents in order to understand the functionality of every overloaded method.

Application of Method Overloading
- Whenever the project or application has same logic to be executed with different type of arguments then we go for method overloading.
