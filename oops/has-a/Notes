RELATION BETWEEN CLASSES IN JAVA:

- The relations between the classes helps in achieving two goals.
(i) Reduce no. of lines of code.
(ii) Code reusuability

- There are two types of relations.
(i) Has-A relation (ii) Is-A relation


(i) Has-A Relation:
- It is a type of relation which is created based on the dependency of one object on the another object.
- It is of two types : (i) Aggreation (ii) Composition


(a) Aggregation :
- It is a type of Has-A relation where existence of one object is not dependent on another object.
- The aggregation is achieved by creating a static reference variable pointing to the object of another class.

Note : System.out.println() is the best example of aggregation has-A relation which helps in hide the class. Here println() method is the method of printStream class.

(b) Composition:
- It is a type of Has-A relation where existence of one object is dependent on another object.
- The aggregation is achieved by creating a non-static reference variable
pointing to the object of another class.
