POLYMORPHISM:
- One entity showing different behaviours at different places is called as polymorphism.
- Polymorphism helps in code flexibility

 There are two type of polymorphism.
(i) Compile time polymorphism
(ii) Runtime polymorphism
Compile time polymorphism
- Binding the method declaration to method definition by the compiler at compile time based on the arguments is called as compile time polymorphism.
- It is also called as static binding.
- Eg. Method overloading and constructor overloading
Runtime polymorphism
- Binding the method declaration to method definition by the jvm at run time based on the object is called as runtime polymorphism.
- It is also called as dynamic binding.
- Eg. Method overriding.

Note :
Using an upcasted reference if you call an overridden method then you always get overridden implementation on subclass implementation.

To achieve runtime polymorphism we have to follow three steps :
(i) Inheritance
(ii) Method overriding
(iii) Upcasting

-To show code flexibility using polymorphism
