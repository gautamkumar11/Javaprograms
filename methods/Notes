A method is named block of codes which perform a specific task and it may or may not return a value.

Syntax
	Access_specifier access_modifier return_type name(arg list)
	{
		Statement; 

		Return;
	}
- The return type of the method can be any primitive datatype or class type or void.
- The return statement of the method is used to return the control from method back to calling method
- Calling method : A method which is calling another method is known as calling method.
- A method which is called by another method is known as called method.
- Every method should be written within only the scope or body of a class.
- No methods will be executed without calling the method.
- If a method is expecting the arguments then you should call the same method by passing the required values matching the datatype.
If you declare the return type of the methods as void then the method returns only the control from called method to back o calling method.
- If the return type of the method is void then the written statement will be written by the compiler even if the programmer miss it.

- If a method is returning a value then the return type of the method should be a primitive datatype or a class type matching the returned value.
- If a method is returning a value then you should store the returned value within a variables matching the return type of the method.
