ACCESS SPECIFIER:

Access specifier are use to provide security for the clases and its members by controlling visibility.

1) public
2) protected
3) package level
4) private


Public :
- If you declare any entity with public access specifier then it can be accessed from the classes present in same package or different package.
- Public classes and its members will have highest visilibty and lowest security.

Used in different package
(i) It is mandatory to use import or fully qualified classname when we want to access the members and methods of different packages. If we don’t do it, then it throw a compile time error.



Protected :
Op- v1 = 100
this is public void test()
- If you declare any entity with protected access specifier then it can be accessed from the classes present in the same package.
- It is partially visibile to another packages.

The class present in different packages can accessed protected members only by inheritance and creating the object of subclass.

Package-level :
- If you declare any entity without any access specifier keyword then those members are considered as package level members.
- Package level members can be accessed only by classes present in same packages.

Private
- If you declare any entity as private specifier then it can be accessed only within the class in which the members are declared.
- Compared to other access specifier private members will have highest security and lowest visibility.
- The subclass can not reduce the visibility of inherited method from superclass. the superclass can only increase the visibility of inherited method from superclass
