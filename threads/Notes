Threads and MultiThreading


* A Thread is an independent part of same program which will get its own
  stack and CPU time for the execution.
  
* Threads are used for performing MULTITASKING in programs / applications.

* Thread creation and execution is a costly with respect to memory and CPU time
  and hence unwanted thread creations should totally avoided.
  
* Whenever JVM starts the execution it creates 3 threads by default
  
  Main thread
  Garbage collector
  Thread Scheduler
  
* By default all the programs in java will be executed in Main Thread.

* In java threads can be created in 2 ways
  - By Extending Thread class
  - By Implementing Runnable interface
